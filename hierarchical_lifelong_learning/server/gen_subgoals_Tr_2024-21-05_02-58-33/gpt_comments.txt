NO: The goal image shows a view of a hallway, which indicates the robot should be facing down a corridor. However, the current observation shows a very close-up view of what looks like a wall or a flat surface, rather than a hallway. This subgoal is inconsistent with the current observation and the low-level task of turning right, as there is no visual indication that the robot is in a position to turn right down a corridor.NO: The goal image shows a view of a hallway, which indicates a significant change in perspective to a more open view down a corridor. However, the current observation shows a very close-up view of what appears to be a wall or flat surface. This suggests that the robot is currently very close to a wall and not in a position to perform a turn and immediately achieve the perspective shown in the goal image. The goal subgoal does not align with the current observation or the task of turning right in the immediate context.NO: The current observation shows a very close-up view of a wall or flat surface, indicating that the robot is right up against it. The goal image, on the other hand, shows a view down a hallway, which implies that the robot should be in an open space with a clear path ahead. The subgoal image does not align with the current observation or with the task of turning right in close proximity to a wall. It suggests a significant movement which doesn't match with immediately turning right from the current observed position.NO: The current observation shows a very close-up view of a wall or flat surface, which suggests the robot is very close to it. The goal image, however, shows an open view down a hallway, indicating that the robot should be in a more open space with a clear path ahead. These two views are inconsistent with each other, considering the robot is supposed to be executing a "Turn right" task. From such a close position to the wall, a significant turn resulting in a hallway view is unlikely, making this subgoal image inconsistent with the current observation and task.NO: The current observation shows a close-up view of what appears to be a wall or flat surface, suggesting that the robot is very close to an obstacle. In contrast, the goal image for the low-level task "Turn right" shows a long view down a hallway. This indicates that the robot should be in a more open space or corridor, which is not consistent with its current situation right next to a wall. The goal image doesn't appropriately match the immediate task and observation, making this subgoal inconsistent.NO: The current observation shows a close-up view of a wall or flat surface. The goal image shows a view down a hallway, indicating that the robot should be in an open space with a clear path ahead. This is inconsistent with the current observation, where the robot is positioned very close to a wall. Therefore, this subgoal image does not properly align with the current situation and immediate task of turning right, making it unsuitable for the given context.NO: The current observation shows a very close-up view of a wall or flat surface, indicating that the robot is very close to it. The goal image shows a view down a hallway, indicating an open space with a clear path ahead. These two images are inconsistent with each other because the subgoal image suggests that the robot should already be in an open hallway, which is not the case given the current close-up view of a wall. This means the subgoal is not appropriate for the current context of executing the "Turn right" task.NO: The current observation shows a very close-up view of a wall or flat surface, indicating that the robot is right next to it. The goal image, however, shows a long view down a hallway, suggesting that the robot would be in an open space with a clear path. There is a significant discrepancy between being very close to a wall and having a wide, open hallway view. Thus, this goal image is not consistent with the current observation or the task of turning right.NO: The current observation shows a very close-up view of a wall or flat surface, indicating the robot is positioned directly against it. The goal image displays a long view down a hallway, which is inconsistent with the current observation. For the task of turning right, we would expect a small change indicating a turn rather than an immediate transition to a long view down a hallway. Hence, this subgoal image does not align well with the current state and the specific low-level task of turning right.NO: The current observation shows a very close-up view of a wall or flat surface, indicating that the robot is positioned very close to it. The goal image, however, shows a long view down a hallway which implies that the robot should already be in a broader, more open area. These two visual perspectives do not align well with each other, and do not make sense for the low-level task of turning right from the current state. The subgoal image does not appropriately match the robot's immediate context.6
