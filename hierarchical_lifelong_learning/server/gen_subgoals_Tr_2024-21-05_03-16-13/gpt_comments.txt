NO: The goal image for the low level task Turn right does not appear to be consistent with the current observation. The current observation shows an indoor office environment, whereas the goal image appears to be a different area with glass doors or windows, suggesting a different location. For the low level task Turn right, the subgoal image should ideally show a slightly different angle of the current environment after turning right, maintaining consistency in location and context.NO: The goal image for the low level task Turn right does not match the current observation. The current observation is of an indoor office environment, while the goal image appears to depict a different area with glass doors or windows. For a consistent Turn right subgoal, the scene should reflect a slight change in the viewing angle within the same location, maintaining a similar environment and context.NO: The goal image for the low level task Turn right is not consistent with the current observation. The current observation shows an indoor office environment with desks and chairs, while the goal image seems to show a different setting with glass doors or windows. For a Turn right task, the subgoal image should represent a slight turn within the same environment, showing a similar scene but from a different angle.NO: The goal image for the low level task Turn right is not consistent with the current observation. The current observation shows an office environment with desks, chairs, and storage boxes, while the goal image seems to depict a different area with glass doors or windows. For a Turn right task, the intermediate subgoal image should reflect a slight right turn from the current location, revealing a similar environment from a different angle to ensure continuity and proper navigation.NO: The goal image for the low level task Turn right is not consistent with the current observation. The current observation shows an office environment with desks, chairs, and various items, while the goal image appears to show a different setting with glass doors or windows. For the task Turn right, the goal image should reflect a change in perspective within the same environment, maintaining similar elements but from a different angle to ensure appropriate guidance for the robot.NO: The goal image for the low level task Turn right is inconsistent with the current observation. The current observation shows an office environment with desks, chairs, and various boxed items, whereas the goal image appears to show a different environment featuring glass doors or windows. For an effective Turn right subgoal, the image should reflect a transition within the same office environment, displaying a slight rightward shift in perspective to guide the robot accurately.NO: The goal image for the low level task Turn right is not consistent with the current observation. The current observation shows an office environment with desks, chairs, and storage boxes, while the goal image depicts a different environment with glass doors or windows. For the Turn right task to be effective, the subgoal image should represent a change in perspective within the same environment, showing a similar scene from a slightly different angle to guide the robot appropriately.NO: The goal image for the low level task Turn right is not consistent with the current observation. The current observation shows an office environment with desks, chairs, and stacked boxes, whereas the goal image appears to depict a different setting with glass doors or windows. For the task Turn right, the subgoal image should reflect a change in perspective within the same office environment, so the robot can maintain its context and location while turning right.NO: The goal image for the low level task Turn right is not consistent with the current observation. The current observation is of an office environment with desks, chairs, and various items, while the goal image depicts a different environment with glass doors or windows. For the Turn right task, the subgoal image should reflect a change in perspective that is within the same environment, showing the scene from a slightly different angle to guide the robot accurately.NO: The goal image for the low level task Turn right is not consistent with the current observation. The current observation captures an office environment with desks, chairs, and various boxes, while the goal image shows a different setting with what appears to be glass doors or windows. For the Turn right task to be appropriate, the subgoal image should reflect a view still within the current office setting but at a new angle consistent with a right turn.2
