NO: The subgoal image does not appear to be consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows an indoor office environment with desks and chairs, while the subgoal image shows a significantly different environment, which appears to be a hallway or open area with no desks or chairs. For the task "Go straight," the subgoal image should reflect a continuation within a similar indoor office environment.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows an indoor office environment with desks and chairs, whereas the subgoal image depicts a different setting, likely a hallway or open area, which does not match the office environment. For a task like "Go straight," the subgoal should be a continuation within the same or a similar office environment.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation image shows an indoor office environment with desks and chairs, while the subgoal image depicts a different setting, likely a hallway or open area, with no desks or chairs. For the task of "Go straight," the subgoal should reflect a location further along the path within the same office environment.NO: The subgoal image does not align well with the current observation or the task "Go straight." The current observation is of an indoor office environment with desks and chairs, whereas the subgoal image appears to depict a different setting, potentially a hallway or open area. Consistency between the current environment and the subgoal is crucial for the robot to perform the task correctly. For "Go straight," the subgoal should show the same indoor office environment further along the path.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows an indoor office environment with desks and chairs, whereas the subgoal image appears to depict a different setting, possibly a hallway or an open area. For the task "Go straight," the subgoal should show a continuation within the same or similar indoor office environment to maintain coherence and provide a clear path for the robot to follow straight ahead.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows an indoor office environment with desks and chairs, whereas the subgoal image depicts a different type of environment possibly a hallway or open area that does not match the office setting. For the task "Go straight," the subgoal image should reflect a destination further along the same path within the same indoor office environment to effectively guide the robot.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows an indoor office environment with desks and chairs, while the subgoal image appears to depict a different setting, possibly a hallway or open area with no desks or chairs. For the task "Go straight," the subgoal should depict a location further along the path within the same office environment to ensure coherence and proper guidance for the robot.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows an indoor office environment with desks and chairs, while the subgoal image looks different, possibly a hallway or open area. For the task "Go straight," the subgoal should reflect a destination further along the same path within the same office environment to ensure proper guidance for the robot.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation presents an indoor office environment with desks and chairs, whereas the subgoal image depicts a different type of area, potentially a hallway or an open space. For the task "Go straight," the subgoal should illustrate a continuation of the same path within the office environment to provide clear navigation guidance to the robot.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows an indoor office environment with desks and chairs, whereas the subgoal image shows a different setting that looks like a hallway or open area without desks or chairs. For the task "Go straight," the subgoal should reflect a continuation within the same office environment to maintain consistency and guide the robot accurately.9
