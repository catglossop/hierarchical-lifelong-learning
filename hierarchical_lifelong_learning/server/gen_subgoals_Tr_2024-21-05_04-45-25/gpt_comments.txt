NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation. The current observation shows a hallway, while the goal image for the low level task Turn right depicts a scene that does not match the perspective nor show the expected change in direction. When executing a turn, the scene should reflect a new direction relative to the original hallway, but the goal image does not provide this visual confirmation.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation and the task Turn right. The current observation shows a straight hallway with doors and walls on both sides. The goal image, although similar, does not exhibit a clear change in direction such as to the right, which would be expected after performing a Turn right action. The scene should indicate a new perspective indicative of turning right, which is not apparent in the goal image.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation and the high-level task of Turn right. The current observation shows a straight hallway with doors and walls on both sides, and the goal image for the low-level task Turn right does not indicate a changed perspective or a new direction to the right. The subgoal does not visually reflect the result of the robot making a right turn, which should show a different segment of the environment, indicating a successful turn.2
