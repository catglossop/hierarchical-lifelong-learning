NO: The current observation shows a close-up of a blank wall or surface, while the goal image for the low-level task shows a view of a long hallway. For the high-level task of "Go straight," the current observation does not seem to align with this task, as the robot appears to be facing an obstruction (likely a wall), making it impossible to continue straight. Therefore, the subgoal image of a hallway is not consistent with the robot's current situation.NO: The current observation shows that the robot is facing a blank or white wall, which indicates it is at a standstill or an obstruction directly in front of it. The goal image for the low-level task of "Go straight" shows a clear, unobstructed hallway, suggesting forward movement. Since the robot cannot continue straight from its current position (it would need to turn or back up first), the goal image is inconsistent with the high-level task and its current observation. Thus, the subgoal image is not appropriate for the current situation.NO: The current observation depicts the robot facing a blank or white wall, implying an obstruction directly in front of it. Meanwhile, the goal image for the low-level task of "Go straight" shows a corridor, representing an unobstructed path ahead. Since the robot cannot continue straight from its current position due to the obstruction (it would need to turn or back up first), the goal image is not consistent with the robot's current view, the high-level task, and the current low-level task. Hence, the subgoal is not appropriate in this context.NO: The current observation shows a close-up view of a blank wall, indicating that the robot is facing an obstruction or has no path ahead to move forward. In contrast, the goal image depicts a clear, unobstructed hallway, which suggests a straight path forward. This discrepancy means the subgoal image of the hallway does not match the current situation, as the robot cannot proceed straight due to the obstruction. Thus, the subgoal is inconsistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task.NO: The current observation shows the robot facing a blank or white wall, which suggests an obstruction directly in front of it. The goal image for the low-level prompt depicts a clear, unobstructed hallway, indicating a path ahead. Since the robot cannot continue straight from its current position due to the obstruction, the goal image is not consistent with the current observation, the high-level task of "Go straight," and the low-level task of "Go straight." Therefore, the subgoal is inappropriate for the given situation.NO: The current observation shows that the robot is facing a blank or white wall, indicating an obstruction directly ahead. The goal image for the low-level prompt, on the other hand, shows a long, unobstructed hallway, which suggests a clear path forward. This inconsistency means that the robot cannot proceed straight from its current position and would need to reorient itself before continuing. Therefore, the goal image is not appropriate for the current observation, the high-level task of "Go straight," and the ongoing low-level task.NO: The current observation shows the robot facing a blank or white wall, indicating that there is an obstruction directly in front of it. The goal image for the low-level task "Go straight" depicts a clear, unobstructed hallway that implies forward movement. Because the robot cannot continue forward from its current position due to the wall, the subgoal of the hallway is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task of "Go straight," and the low-level task of "Go straight." Thus, this subgoal is inappropriate for the current situation.NO: The current observation shows the robot facing a blank or white wall, indicating that it is obstructed from moving forward. The goal image for the low-level task "Go straight" depicts a clear, unobstructed hallway, suggesting an open path ahead. Since the robot cannot continue straight from its current position due to the obstruction, the goal image does not align with the robot's current observation or the high-level task of "Go straight." Therefore, this subgoal is inappropriate for the given situation.NO: The current observation shows the robot facing a blank or white wall, indicating that there is an obstruction directly in front of it. The goal image for the low-level task "Go straight" portrays a clear, unobstructed hallway, suggesting an open path ahead. Since the robot cannot proceed straight due to the obstruction, the goal image is inconsistent with the current observation, high-level task of "Go straight," and the executed low-level task of "Go straight." Therefore, the subgoal is inappropriate for the given situation.NO: The current observation shows the robot facing a blank or white surface, indicating an obstruction directly in front of it. The goal image for the low-level task "Go straight" depicts a clear, unobstructed hallway, suggesting an open path ahead. Since the robot cannot continue straight due to the obstruction, the goal image does not align with the current observation or the high-level task of "Go straight." Therefore, this subgoal is not appropriate for the current situation.2
