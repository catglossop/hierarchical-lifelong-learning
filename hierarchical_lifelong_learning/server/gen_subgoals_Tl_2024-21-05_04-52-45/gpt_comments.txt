NO: The subgoal image does not show a view that is consistent with having turned left from the observation image. The observation image focuses on chairs and desks directly ahead and to the right, while the subgoal image shows an area that should be to the left, but instead seems somewhat similar to the original direction. The environment visible in the subgoal image does not match what we'd expect after a left turn from the current observation.NO: The subgoal image appears to be very similar to the current observation image, suggesting that the robot has not actually turned left. For a proper left turn, we would expect the subgoal image to show a different view, indicating a 90-degree turn to the left from the current observation. The significant similarity between the two images indicates that the goal of turning left has not been adequately met.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with having performed a left turn from the current observation. The subgoal image is almost identical to the observation image, suggesting that the robot has not turned left. After turning left, we would expect to see a different perspective in the subgoal image, reflecting the new direction the robot is facing.0
