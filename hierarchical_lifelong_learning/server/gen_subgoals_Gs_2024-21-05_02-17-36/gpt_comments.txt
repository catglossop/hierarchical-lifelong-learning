NO: The subgoal image shows a hallway, suggesting the robot should be in a hallway setting while following the instruction "Go straight." However, the current observation is of a blank wall and does not indicate the robot is in a hallway. This inconsistency suggests that the subgoal image does not align with the robot's current observation or the task at hand.NO: The subgoal image depicts a hallway, but the current observation shows a close-up of a blank wall. This suggests that the robot may be facing an obstruction or something inconsistent with the scenario of it moving down a hallway. Therefore, the subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, nor does it appropriately support the high level task of "Go straight."NO: The subgoal image depicts a hallway, but the robot's current observation shows a blank wall, implying it is not currently in a hallway or facing down a corridor. This indicates a mismatch. For the high level task "Go straight," the environment should show a pathway consistent with moving forward, not a blank wall. Hence, this subgoal image is not appropriate given the current observation and task.NO: The subgoal image depicts a hallway, whereas the robot's current observation shows a blank wall, indicating that the robot is not in a hallway. For the high level task "Go straight," the subgoal should reflect a consistent environment that allows for forward movement, not an obstacle such as a blank wall. Therefore, this subgoal image is not appropriate given the current observation and the tasks.NO: The goal image depicts a hallway, while the robot's current observation shows a blank wall. This indicates a scenario inconsistency. For the task "Go straight," the observation should be indicative of an environment compatible with straightforward movement, such as a hallway or corridor scene. The current observation does not align with the described subgoal of moving straight. Thus, the subgoal is not appropriately aligned with the current observation and task.NO: The goal image depicts a hallway, while the robot's current observation shows a blank wall. For the robot to successfully execute the task "Go straight," its observation should typically align with an open pathway similar to the subgoal image. The discrepancy between the current observation of a blank wall and the subgoal image of a hallway indicates that the subgoal is not appropriate given the current observation and task.NO: The subgoal image depicts a hallway that implies an open path forward, but the robot's current observation shows a blank wall, which indicates an obstruction or that the robot is not currently in a hallway. For the high level task "Go straight," the environment should allow for continuous forward movement, and the current observation does not support this. Therefore, the subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task.NO: The subgoal image shows a hallway, suggesting an open passage for moving straight ahead. However, the robot's current observation is of a blank wall, which indicates that it is either facing an obstacle or is not in a position to move straight in a hallway setting. This inconsistency means that the subgoal image is not appropriate given the current observation and the intended tasks.NO: The subgoal image shows a hallway, which is an appropriate setting for the task "Go straight." However, the robot's current observation shows a blank wall, indicating that it is either up against an obstacle or not in a hallway environment where it could move straight ahead. This discrepancy between the current observation and the subgoal means that the subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation or the overall task.NO: The subgoal image shows a hallway, indicating an appropriate environment for the task "Go straight." However, the robot's current observation shows a blank wall, which suggests that the robot is not in a position to move forward in a hallway. This discrepancy means that the subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation or the overall task of moving straight.0
