NO: The goal image does not match the current observation or the task. The current observation shows a hallway and office space with chairs, while the goal image shows an enclosed space with structural elements to both sides. For a Turn right task, the goal image should resemble a perspective indicating a right turn within a similarly open or semi-open space, not an abrupt transition to what appears to be a different area entirely.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation or the task. The current observation shows a hallway and office setup, while the goal image displays an enclosed space with distinctive structural elements that are not visible in the current observation. For a Turn right task, the goal image should depict a scenario where the robot has turned right, with a corresponding similar hallway or open office space in view. This goal image does not align with the expected outcome of executing a right turn in the current environment.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation or the task. The current observation shows a hallway with office spaces and furniture, while the goal image depicts an enclosed space flanked by structural elements on both sides. For the high level task "Turn right" and the low level task "Turn right," the goal image should reflect a right turn within a similar open environment. This goal image does not show a continuation of the hallway or an office space that would logically follow a right turn from the current observation.0
