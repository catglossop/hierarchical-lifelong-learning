NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation and the high or low-level task of Stop. The current observation shows a plain wall, whereas the goal image shows a different environment with distinct structures. For the task "Stop," the goal image should closely resemble the current observation, indicating that the robot has stopped in its current position.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation or the low-level task of Stop. The current observation shows a plain wall, while the goal image shows a different environment with distinct structures. For the task "Stop," the goal image should closely match the current observation, indicating that the robot has stopped in its current position without any change in view.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation or the low-level task of Stop. The current observation shows a plain wall, while the goal image shows a different environment with distinct structures. For the task "Stop," the goal image should closely match the current observation, indicating that the robot has stopped in its current position without any change in its surroundings.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation or the low-level task of Stop. The current observation shows a plain wall, while the goal image shows a different part of the environment with distinct structures and objects. For the Stop task, the goal image should closely resemble the current observation, indicating that the robot has stopped and the environment hasnâ€™t changed.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, or low-level task of Stop. The current observation shows a plain wall, while the goal image shows a different environment with distinct structures. For the Stop task, the goal image should closely match the current observation to indicate that the robot has successfully stopped in its current position.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, or low-level task of Stop. The current observation shows a plain wall, while the goal image depicts a different environment with distinct structures and objects. For the task of stopping, the goal image should closely resemble the current observation to indicate that the robot has successfully stopped without any change in its immediate environment.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, or low-level task of Stop. The current observation shows a plain wall, while the goal image shows an entirely different environment with distinct features. For the task of stopping, the goal image should closely resemble the current observation to indicate that the robot has halted in its present location without any change in its surroundings.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, or low-level task of Stop. The current observation shows a plain wall, while the goal image shows a different environment with distinct structures. For the task of Stop, the goal image should closely resemble the current observation to indicate that the robot has stopped in its current position without any change in its surroundings.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, or low-level task of Stop. The current observation shows a plain wall, whereas the goal image depicts a different environment with distinct features and objects. For the task of stopping, the goal image should closely match the current observation, indicating that the robot has stopped in its immediate current view without any change in its surroundings.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, or low-level task of Stop. The current observation shows a plain wall, whereas the goal image depicts a different environment with distinct features. For the task of stopping, the goal image should closely match the current observation to indicate that the robot has stopped in its immediate current position without any change in its surroundings.0
