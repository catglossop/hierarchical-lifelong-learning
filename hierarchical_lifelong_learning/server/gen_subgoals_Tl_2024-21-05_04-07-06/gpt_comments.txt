NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows the robot facing a set of offices and chairs, while the subgoal image depicts a different scene with a distinct hallway layout and objects. If the robot were to turn left, the subgoal image should reflect a view that aligns with the immediate left-turn perspective from the current observation. The current subgoal image indicates a considerable missmatch, signaling that this subgoal image is inappropriate for the task.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows the robot in front of offices and chairs, while the subgoal image shows a completely different setting with the view of a hallway and individuals in the background. If the robot were executing a left turn, the goal image should display a scene that would logically follow a left turn from the current position, which this subgoal image does not. Thus, the subgoal is not appropriate for the task.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation is of the inside of an office area with visible desks, chairs, and doors, while the goal image shows a corridor with a significantly different setting, including a figure walking away. For the task "Turn left," the subgoal image should represent the immediate left-turn view from the current positionâ€”something that would still include elements of the office environment observed initially. Thus, the provided subgoal image does not accurately correspond to the low level task and current observation.0
