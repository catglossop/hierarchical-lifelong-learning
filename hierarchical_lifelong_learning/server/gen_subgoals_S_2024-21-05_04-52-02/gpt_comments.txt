NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows the robot in an office environment with chairs and desks, while the subgoal image depicts a hallway. The subgoal image should closely resemble the current observation if the robot's task is to stop.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The robot's current observation shows it in an office environment with chairs and desks, while the subgoal image depicts a hallway. If the high-level task is to stop, the subgoal image should match the current observation to indicate that the robot is stopping in its current location.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The robot's current observation shows it in an office environment with chairs and desks, while the subgoal image depicts a hallway. For the high-level task Stop and the low-level task Stop, the subgoal image should closely match the current observation to indicate that the robot is stopping in its present location.0
