NO: The current observation does not match the goal image for the low level task of "Stop." The robot's current observation shows a different environment with distinct items and a different layout compared to the generated subgoal image. Therefore, the subgoal is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task of "Stop." The current observation shows a different environment with specific furniture and objects that are not present in the goal image. Since the robot's task is to stop, the subgoal should reflect the current surroundings accurately, which this generated subgoal does not.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task of "Stop." The current observation shows a specific office environment with furniture and objects that are distinctly different from those in the goal image. The robot's task of stopping should ideally reflect the immediate surroundings, and in this case, the visual cues do not match, making the subgoal inappropriate.2
