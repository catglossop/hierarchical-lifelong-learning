NO: The goal image for the low level task 'Turn left' does not appear consistent with the robot's current observation. The initial observation shows the robot in a corridor facing doors and a workspace area, while the goal image shows a different corridor with a noticeably different layout and visual features. The goal image should have depicted a similar scene but rotated to indicate a left turn. This mismatched scene suggests that the robot is not turning left in the same environment.NO: The goal image does not match the current observation and task. The current observation shows the robot in a corridor facing doors and office spaces, while the goal image shows a different corridor. For a turn left task, the goal image should illustrate what the environment would look like after the robot has turned left from its current position. The significant difference in the environments indicates that this goal image does not correctly represent a left turn in the current setting.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The first image shows the robot in a corridor facing office doors and workspaces. For a "Turn left" task, the goal image should depict the expected view after making a left turn from the current position. However, the goal image presents a different corridor entirely, suggesting a different location. This discrepancy indicates that the subgoal is not accurately representing a left turn in the given environment.NO: The goal image does not appear to be consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows the robot in a corridor facing office spaces and doors, whereas the goal image shows a different corridor with different visual characteristics and features. For a "Turn left" task, the subgoal image should present a view similar to what the robot would see after turning left from its current position. The divergence in the environment portrayed in the images indicates that this subgoal does not accurately represent the expected outcome of the low level task "Turn left."NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows the robot in an office corridor with several doors and workspaces visible. The goal image, meant to represent the result of turning left, shows a different corridor with dissimilar features and layout. To be consistent, the goal image should show a similar environment to the current observation, but from the perspective of having turned left. These differences indicate that the goal image does not accurately represent the outcome of the low level task "Turn left" in the given context.YES: The subgoal image is consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows the robot facing a corridor with doors and workspaces, and the goal image shows what the scene might look like after turning left, with a similar indoor environment layout but adjusted to a new perspective. This indicates that after the robot turns left, it will see a corridor that aligns with the features seen in the current environment. Thus, the subgoal image appropriately represents the expected outcome of executing the "Turn left" task.
