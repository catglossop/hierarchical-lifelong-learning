NO: The goal image for the low level task "Turn left" is inconsistent with the current observation. The current observation shows an environment with chairs and desks, but the generated subgoal image does not align with this setting. When turning left, the subgoal image should ideally reflect a 90-degree change in perspective of the current environment, showing a different view but still containing recognizable elements from the original scene. This subgoal image appears to depict a completely different setting, implying an incorrect transition.NO: The goal image for the low level task "Turn left" is inconsistent with the current observation. When executing a "Turn left" action, the subgoal image should present a view that reflects a 90-degree change in perspective to the left from the current scene. However, the generated subgoal image does not represent a logical next perspective given the initial environment shown in the current observation. The elements in the subgoal image do not align with those visible from the initial perspective.NO: The goal image for the low level task "Turn left" is not consistent with the current observation. When performing a "Turn left" action, the expected subgoal image should display a view that one would reasonably see after turning 90 degrees to the left from the current observation. In this case, the subgoal image does not show any observable continuity or logical progression from the current scene. The generated goal image appears to represent a completely different environment, making it an unsuitable subgoal for the specified tasks.0
