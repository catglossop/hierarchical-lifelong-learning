NO: The goal image for the low level task "Turn left" does not match the current observation. The current observation shows office equipment, desks, and doors, whereas the goal image shows a hallway or corridor with different structural features. Therefore, the subgoal is inconsistent with the current observation and does not help the robot achieve its high level task of turning left within the given environment.NO: The goal image for the low level task "Turn left" does not match the current observation. The current observation shows an office environment with visible desks, chairs, a door, and some bins. The goal image, on the other hand, shows a corridor or hallway without these items. The structural features and the overall scene are significantly different, making it an unsuitable subgoal for the task of turning left in the current environment.NO: The goal image for the low level task "Turn left" does not match the current observation. The robot is currently in an office environment with desks, chairs, and bins, while the goal image shows a corridor or hallway that looks completely different in terms of structure and surroundings. There is no visible sign of a left turn being made within a similar environment, making the subgoal inconsistent with both the current observation and the task.0
