NO: The goal image for the low-level task Stop shows the robot further down the hallway compared to its current observation. For the high-level task Stop, the subgoal image should closely match the current observation to indicate that the robot has successfully stopped at the current location. The goal image is not consistent with the current observation and the high-level task of stopping.NO: The goal image for the low-level task of Stop should closely resemble the current observation to indicate that the robot has successfully stopped at its current location. However, the goal image shows a different viewpoint and location down the hallway, which does not match the current observation. This discrepancy indicates that the robot has not yet reached the goal location for stopping, making the goal image inconsistent with both the current observation and the high-level task of stopping.NO: The goal image for the low-level task of Stop should closely match the current observation, indicating that the robot has successfully stopped at its current location. In this case, the goal image shows a different location and viewpoint down the hallway, which does not align with the current observation. This inconsistency means the goal image is not suitable for the high-level task of stopping, as it does not confirm that the robot has stopped at its current position.0
