NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The robot's current observation shows a plain wall, which suggests that it is in a stationary position or facing an obstruction. In contrast, the goal image seems to depict an entirely different and unclear scene, potentially unrelated to the indoor environment or task at hand. For the task "Go straight," the subgoal image should display a continuation of the pathway or hallway, indicating forward progress.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The robot's current observation shows a plain wall, which means it is either stationary or facing an obstruction. The goal image, on the other hand, is an indiscernible and abstract scene that does not match any recognizable continuation of the environment. For the task "Go straight," the subgoal image should indicate that the robot is making progressive movement forward in the same environment, which is not the case here.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The robot's current observation shows a plain wall, indicating it is either stationary or facing an obstruction. The goal image, on the other hand, is abstract and does not provide any clear visual cues related to the environment. For the task "Go straight," the subgoal image should depict a continued view along the current path or hallway, indicating forward movement, which is not illustrated in this goal image.0
