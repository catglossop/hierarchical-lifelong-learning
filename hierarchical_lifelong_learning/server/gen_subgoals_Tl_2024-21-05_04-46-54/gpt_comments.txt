NO: The subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation and the low-level task of turning left. In the current observation, the robot is facing a corner with a wall, but in the subgoal image, the robot has already completed a left turn and is facing a different section of the hallway or room. The subgoal image does not represent an intermediate step but rather a final position, implying that the robot has already completed the turn. Therefore, the goal image is not suitable for guiding the robot through the process of turning left from its current observation.YES: The subgoal image is consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. In the current observation, the robot is facing a corner where it needs to turn left. The subgoal image shows the immediate perspective once the left turn has started, facing a new section with the corner still partially visible to the right. This demonstrates a correct intermediate step for the robot while executing the low-level task "Turn left."
