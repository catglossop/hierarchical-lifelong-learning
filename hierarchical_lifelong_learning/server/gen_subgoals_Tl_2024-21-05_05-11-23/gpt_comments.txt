NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and low level task. The current observation shows a blank wall, indicating the robot has not completed the turn yet. The goal image shows a scene down a hallway, which would not be visible if the robot is in the process of turning left. The goal image should show a partial view of the new direction including some portion of the scene to indicate that it has turned left successfully.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and low level task. The current observation shows a blank wall, indicating that the robot has not yet completed its turn. The goal image, on the other hand, shows a scene down a hallway, which would be visible only after the turn is completed. For the subgoal to be appropriate, it should show a scene that indicates the robot is partially through its turn, not a completely different setting that would only be visible after completing the turn.NO: The subgoal image does not align well with the current observation and low-level task. The initial observation indicates that the robot is facing a blank wall, suggesting it has started or is midway through its turn. The goal image displays a hallway scene that would be visible after completing the turn. An appropriate subgoal image should showcase a scene indicative of the robot being partway through its left turn, not an entirely different setting visible after the turn is finalized.0
