NO: The subgoal image shows a different environment from the current observation. The furniture and layout in the observation image, such as the doors and room setup, don't match with those in the subgoal image. For the low-level task "Turn right," the immediate surroundings should be more consistent, showing a slight right adjustment of the current scene; this subgoal image does not display that.NO: The subgoal image does not align well with the current observation. The subgoal image displays a different environment with distinct features such as different doors and objects. For a "Turn right" subgoal, the scene would typically show a right shift of the current viewpoint, maintaining some of the same visual elements. However, the discrepancy between the objects and spatial arrangements in the current observation and goal image suggests this subgoal is not appropriate.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and the low-level task. The current observation shows a hallway with distinct elements like doors and glass panels. The subgoal image, however, depicts a different environment with different features, such as the location and appearance of objects, which do not align with the current observation. For the high-level task "Turn right" and the low-level task "Turn right," the subsequent image should show a slight rightward shift of the current scene, maintaining some continuity in the environment. This inconsistency indicates that this subgoal is not appropriate.0
