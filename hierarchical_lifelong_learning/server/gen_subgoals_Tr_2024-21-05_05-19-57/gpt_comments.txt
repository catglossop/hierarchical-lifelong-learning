NO: The subgoal image does not match the current observation or the tasks. The robot's current observation shows a hallway with rooms visible along the sides. If the robot is supposed to be turning right, we would expect the goal image to show a perspective that matches what the robot would see after partially or fully completing a right turn, presumably still showing some of the same elements from the current hallway. The given subgoal image instead shows a different hallway, which does not align properly with the current environment and tasks.NO: The subgoal image presented does not align with the current observation or the tasks. While the robot is executing the "Turn right" action, the second image does not show a perspective consistent with completing or progressing through a right turn from the initial hallway view. Instead, it depicts a different hallway that doesn't match any logical continuation or partial turn view from the original observation image. The expected subgoal image should show a partial right turn or a similar environment that suggests the robot is in the process of turning right within the same hallway.NO: The subgoal image presented is inconsistent with the current observation and the tasks. For a robot currently executing a "Turn right" task, the goal image should depict a perspective that matches the expected view after partially or fully turning right. The current observation shows a hallway with side rooms, but the goal image shows a completely different hallway, indicating a different setting. Therefore, it does not correspond to a continuation or completion of a right turn from the robotâ€™s current position.2
