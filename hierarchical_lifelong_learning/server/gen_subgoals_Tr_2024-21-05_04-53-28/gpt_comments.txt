NO: The subgoal image does not appear to be consistent with the current observation or the low-level task of "Turn right." The current observation shows an indoor office setting with chairs and desks. In contrast, the goal image depicts a more open hallway space with a different layout and environment. The subgoal image should show a similar setting as the current observation but with a slight turn to the right, not a completely different environment.NO: The subgoal provided does not align well with the current observation and the low-level task of "Turn right." The robot's current observation shows an office environment with chairs and desks, whereas the subgoal image shows a corridor or hallway setting, which is significantly different in layout. A correct subgoal image should depict a similar scene to the current observation, with a slight rightward adjustment in perspective, not a completely different environment.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and the low-level task of "Turn right." The current observation is an office setting with desks and chairs, while the subgoal image depicts a corridor or hallway, which has a notably different environment. For a "Turn right" subgoal, the image should display a similar office environment with the perspective slightly turned to the right, indicating the robot's next expected view if it performs the action correctly. The disparity in environments makes this subgoal image inappropriate.2
