NO: The subgoal image (second image) is not clearly depicting a scene that is consistent with the current observation (first image). The first image shows an indoor office environment with chairs and desks, while the second image is too abstract and doesn't provide recognisable details that match with the surroundings in the first image. To achieve the high-level task of "Go straight," the subgoal image should ideally show a forward path within a similar context.NO: The subgoal image does not provide a meaningful depiction that aligns with the current observation or the task of going straight. The second image is highly abstract and doesn't show any discernible features that match the environment in the first image, making it difficult for the robot to use this subgoal to navigate and proceed with the task accurately.NO: The subgoal image does not provide a clear and accurate representation that would guide the robot in its current task of going straight. The second image is abstract and lacks features that correspond to the environment depicted in the first image, making it unsuitable for helping the robot achieve the goal of moving straight ahead.0
