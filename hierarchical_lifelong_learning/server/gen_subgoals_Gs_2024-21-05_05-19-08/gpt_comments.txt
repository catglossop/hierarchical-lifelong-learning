NO: The goal image does not align well with the current observation and the tasks provided. In the goal image, the lighting conditions and environment setup appear different from the current observation image. For a "Go straight" task, the goal image should ideally show a continuation of the hallway or path seen in the current observation image, but there are significant differences that make this subgoal inconsistent.NO: The goal image does not match well with the current observation for the "Go straight" task. Although the environment seems somewhat similar, the differences in lighting and the overall scene composition suggest a different location. For the subgoal to be good, the goal image should reflect a continuation of the current hallway or path in a way that aligns closely with the current observation, including similar lighting and similar visual elements.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The goal image has different lighting conditions and visual elements that do not match the current observation. For the task "Go straight," the goal image should depict a continuation of the current hallway with similar visual cues, such as lighting, wall color, and layout. The discrepancies between the two images indicate that this subgoal image is not appropriate for the "Go straight" task.0
