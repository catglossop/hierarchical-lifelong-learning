NO: The subgoal image does not seem consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows an office-like environment with chairs and desks, while the subgoal image depicts a hallway or corridor. The environments are not matching, and the subgoal image does not reflect a position that results from turning left in the current observation.NO: The subgoal image depicts a completely different environment—a hallway or corridor—compared to the robot's current observation of an office-like space with chairs and desks. For the subgoal to be consistent with the low-level task of turning left, the goal image should reflect a view that logically follows from turning left in the current setting.NO: The subgoal image depicts a hallway or corridor, which does not match the current observation of an office-like space with chairs and desks. When the robot is executing the low-level task "Turn left" within the office environment, the resulting subgoal image should show a scene that logically follows from turning left in that specific environment. The stark difference in settings between the current observation and the goal image indicates that the subgoal is not appropriate for the given task.2
