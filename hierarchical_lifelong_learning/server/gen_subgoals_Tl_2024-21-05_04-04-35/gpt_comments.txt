YES: The subgoal image is consistent with the current observation and the tasks. The current observation shows the robot facing a hallway with rooms on the right-hand side. The goal of turning left should result in a significant change in view, such as entering another area or room. The subgoal image depicts an environment with chairs and tables. This change in scene indicates that the robot has turned left and is facing a new area, aligning with both the high level task (Turn left) and the low level task (Turn left).
