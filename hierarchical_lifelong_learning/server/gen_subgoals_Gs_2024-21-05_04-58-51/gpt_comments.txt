NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and the tasks at hand. The current observation shows the robot in an office-like environment with chairs and desks. The goal image, however, depicts a hallway with different lighting and layout. Since the current low level task is Go forward, a valid subgoal image should represent a slight forward advancement in a similar indoor office environment. The significant difference between the environments in the observation and the goal image indicates that this is not a good subgoal.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and the tasks at hand. The current observation shows the robot in an office-like environment with chairs and desks, while the subgoal image shows a hallway with a very different setting. Since both the high level task and the low level task are Go straight, the subgoal image should represent a forward progression in a similar office environment. The substantial difference between the environments in the observation and the subgoal image indicates a mismatch, making this a bad subgoal.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and the tasks at hand. The current observation shows the robot in an office-like environment with chairs and desks, whereas the subgoal image depicts a hallway with different colors and layout. Since the robot's high level task and low level task are both Go straight, the subgoal image needs to reflect a forward advancement in the same type of environment as the current observation, i.e., the office setting. Therefore, the significant difference between the environments indicates that this subgoal is not appropriate.2
