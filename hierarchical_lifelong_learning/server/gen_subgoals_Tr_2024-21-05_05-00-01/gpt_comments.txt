NO: The goal image does not match the contextual environment of the current observation. The robot is in an office setting with chairs and desks, while the goal image depicts a completely different environment, possibly a corridor or a lobby. This discrepancy suggests that the goal image is not appropriate for the low-level task of "Turn right" in the given context.NO: The goal image depicts a different environment, likely a corridor or public space, which is inconsistent with the robot's current observation inside an office setting with chairs and desks. For the low-level task "Turn right," the goal image should reflect a forward-facing view after a right turn in the same or similar office environment.NO: The subgoal image for the "Turn right" task shows a completely different environment from the current observation. The robot is in an office-like setting with chairs and desks, while the goal image appears to be from a different area, possibly a corridor or open space. A consistent subgoal should show what the environment looks like after a right turn within the same setting.0
