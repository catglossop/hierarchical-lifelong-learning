NO: The subgoal image does not align well with the current observation for the low-level task "Turn right." The current observation shows a relatively straight hallway with doors and windows, whereas the goal image is significantly different, featuring a dark and blurry environment with little discernible similarity to the original scene. The goal should represent the immediate visual change the robot would expect to see after turning right in its current environment.NO: The subgoal image does not correspond well with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a well-lit hallway with clear features such as doors and windows, while the subgoal image is dark and blurry, with no clear alignment to the immediate visual change expected when turning right from the current location. The goal image should ideally show a scene that reasonably follows from turning right in the current environment.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task of "Turn right." The current observation depicts a well-lit hallway with clear visual elements such as doors and windows. In contrast, the subgoal image is dark and blurry, making it hard to ascertain its relevance to the observed environment. For a "Turn right" task, the goal image should more accurately represent the anticipated view after making a right turn from the current position.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a bright, well-lit hallway with clear lines and structures. The subgoal image, however, is dark and blurry, making it hard to discern any meaningful transition that would result from a "Turn right" action in the given environment. For a "Turn right" task, the subgoal image should visually align more closely with the expected view after making a right turn from the current location.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a bright, well-defined hallway with clear structures like doors and lights. The goal image is dim and blurry, making it difficult to relate it to a realistic view that the robot would see after turning right from the current location. A proper subgoal image for the task "Turn right" should depict an expected view after making a right turn in the observed environment, maintaining similar lighting and structural cues.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a brightly lit hallway with clear structural features like doors and lights, while the subgoal image is dark and blurry, lacking any discernible features that would logically follow from turning right in the given environment. A good subgoal image for the task "Turn right" should present a clear and coherent view that would reasonably appear after making a right turn from the robot's current position.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a well-lit corridor with clear and distinct features like doors and lights. The subgoal image is dark and blurry, which does not provide a coherent or logical view that would be expected after making a right turn in the given environment. For the task "Turn right," the subgoal image should clearly depict what the scene would look like immediately after completing the turn, while maintaining similar lighting and structural features.NO: The subgoal image does not correspond well with the current observation for the low-level task "Turn right." The current observation is a brightly lit corridor with doors, windows, and lights, which are clear and distinct. The subgoal image is dark and blurry, lacking any discernible features that would logically follow from turning right in the given environment. For the task "Turn right," the subgoal image should provide a clear view that realistically follows from making a right turn from the current observation, maintaining similar lighting and environment characteristics.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a well-lit corridor with distinct features such as doors, windows, and lights. In contrast, the subgoal image is dark, blurry, and lacks any clear similarity to the observed environment, making it difficult to see how it represents the outcome of turning right. A suitable subgoal image should realistically show what the robot would expect to see after making a right turn from its current position, maintaining similar lighting and structural features.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a bright, well-illuminated hallway with clear lines and features. However, the subgoal image is dark and blurry, lacking any discernible features that correlate with the expected view after turning right in such an environment. For the task "Turn right," the subgoal image should represent what the robot would reasonably see after making the right turn in the given context, including similar lighting and structural elements.1
