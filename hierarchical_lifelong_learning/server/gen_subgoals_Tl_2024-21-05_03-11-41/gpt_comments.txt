NO: The subgoal image does not match the current observation for the low level task "Turn left." The current observation shows the robot facing a hallway with a white wall on the right and an open space on the left. The subgoal image should show a view after turning, which means the new view should be looking down the hallway that was initially on the left. The provided goal image does not seem to align with this expected result, hence it does not appear consistent with the "Turn left" task.NO: The subgoal image does not correctly reflect the expected outcome for the "Turn left" task. The current observation shows a hallway with a white wall to the right and an open space to the left. After executing a "Turn left," the goal image should show the view looking down the hallway that was initially to the left. The provided subgoal image has a different lighting condition and context, indicating it does not match the expected view after the turn.NO: The subgoal image does not appropriately reflect the expected outcome for the low-level task "Turn left." The current observation shows a hallway with a white wall on the right and open space on the left. After executing a "Turn left," the goal image should depict a new perspective looking down the hallway that was initially on the left. The provided subgoal image does not match this scenario and context, indicating it is not consistent with the task requirements.NO: The subgoal image does not adequately represent the expected result of the "Turn left" action. The current observation displays a hallway with a white wall to the right and an open space to the left. After executing a "Turn left" action, the goal image should display the view looking down the hallway that was initially to the left. The provided subgoal image appears to have an entirely different context and lighting, suggesting it does not correspond to the expected outcome of the turn left task from this observation.NO: The subgoal image does not properly reflect the expected outcome for the "Turn left" low-level task. The current observation shows a hallway with a white wall on the right side and an open space on the left side. After executing a "Turn left" action, the goal image should show a perspective looking down the hallway that was initially to the left. The provided subgoal image does not match this expected view and context, indicating it is not consistent with the task requirements.NO: The subgoal image does not accurately reflect the expected outcome of the low-level task "Turn left." The current observation shows a hallway with a white wall on the right and an open space on the left. After executing the "Turn left" action, the goal image should show a perspective looking down the hallway that was initially on the left. The provided subgoal image depicts a different scene and context, indicating that it is not consistent with the task's requirements.NO: The subgoal image does not properly reflect the expected outcome for the "Turn left" low-level task. The current observation shows a hallway with a white wall on the right and an open space on the left. After executing a "Turn left" action, the goal image should show a perspective looking down the hallway that was initially on the left. The provided subgoal image shows a significantly different scene and context, indicating that it is not consistent with the current observation, the high-level task, or the low-level task.NO: The subgoal image does not accurately reflect the expected outcome for the low-level task "Turn left." The current observation shows a hallway with a white wall on the right side and an open space on the left side. After executing the "Turn left" action, the goal image should display a perspective now facing down the hallway that was initially on the left. The subgoal image provided shows a different scene that does not align with the expectation based on the current observation and the turn left task.NO: The subgoal image does not match the expected outcome for the low-level task "Turn left." The current observation shows a hallway with a white wall on the right and an open space on the left. After executing a "Turn left" action, the goal image should show a perspective looking down the hallway that was initially on the left. The provided subgoal image displays a different scene with different elements, indicating it is not consistent with the current observation and the "Turn left" task.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, or low-level task. The current observation shows a hallway with a white wall on the right and an open space on the left. After executing a "Turn left" action, the goal image should show the perspective down the hallway that was initially on the left. The provided subgoal image has different elements and context, which does not align with the expected view after turning left from the current observation.8
