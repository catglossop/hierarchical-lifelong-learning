NO: The subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation and the high level task of "Go straight". The current observation shows a hallway with doors and a whiteboard on the side, whereas the subgoal image displays a different environment with windows and different structural elements. For the task of going straight, the subgoal should show an environment that appears further along the same hallway shown in the current observation, not a completely different location.NO: The subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation and the high level task of "Go straight". The current observation shows a hallway with specific features such as doors and a whiteboard, whereas the subgoal image shows a different location with windows and different lighting conditions. For the task of going straight, the subgoal should reflect a perspective further along the same hallway shown in the current observation.NO: The subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation and the high level task of "Go straight." The current observation shows a hallway with doors and a whiteboard. However, the subgoal image shows a different environment with windows and a different layout. For the task of going straight, the subgoal should visually align with a perspective further down the same hallway shown in the current observation, maintaining continuity in the scene's features.NO: The subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation and the high level task of "Go straight." The current observation shows a hallway with doors, a whiteboard, and no windows, whereas the subgoal image depicts a different environment that includes windows and different structural elements. For this task, the subgoal image should reflect a continuation of the same hallway, showing a forward progression from the robot's current point of view.NO: The subgoal image does not align well with the current observation and the high-level task of "Go straight." The current observation depicts a hallway with specific features such as doors and a whiteboard on the right side. In contrast, the subgoal image shows a different environment, with windows and different structural elements, indicating a considerable change in location. For the goal to be considered good, the subgoal should represent a perspective that appears to be further forward along the same hallway shown in the current observation.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and the high-level task of "Go straight." The current observation shows a hallway with enclosed walls and doors, while the subgoal image shows a different environment with windows and different layout. For the goal image to be valid, it should depict a progression forward within the same hallway, maintaining the same structural features, indicating that the robot has continued straight along the same path.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and the high-level task of "Go straight." The current observation shows a hallway with doors and a whiteboard, distinctive features of this specific hallway. On the other hand, the subgoal image shows a different environment with windows and different structural elements, which does not align with the continuation or progression along the same hallway. For the subgoal to be appropriate, it should represent an image further along the same hallway, maintaining the continuity and consistency of the environment features seen in the current observation.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation or the task. The current observation shows a hallway with specific features like doors and a whiteboard. However, the subgoal image shows a different environment with windows and different structural elements. If the task is to "Go straight," the goal image should reflect a perspective of moving further along the same hallway, maintaining the consistency of the observed environment.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and the high-level task of "Go straight." The current observation shows a hallway with doors and a whiteboard, indicating a specific enclosed environment. The subgoal image shows a different environment with windows and a different layout. For the task of going straight, the subgoal should represent a continuation of the current hallway, maintaining the same visual and structural elements seen in the current observation.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and the high-level task of "Go straight." The current observation shows a hallway with doors, a whiteboard, and enclosed walls, whereas the subgoal image depicts an environment with windows and different structural elements. For the task of going straight, the subgoal image should reflect a perspective that appears further along the same hallway shown in the current observation, maintaining the continuity of the scene's features.0
