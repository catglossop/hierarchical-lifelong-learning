YES: The goal image is consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. Both images display a similar hallway environment, indicating that the robot needs to continue moving forward (Go straight) to progress towards the goal. The perspective shift in the goal image suggests the robot will have moved further down the hallway, matching the high-level task of "Go straight" and the low-level task of "Go straight."
