NO: The goal image shows a different environment, possibly an office or room with furniture, whereas the current observation shows a plain wall with shadows. The environments do not match, making this subgoal inconsistent with the current observation.NO: The goal image does not match the current observation. The current observation shows a plain wall with shadows, which suggests the robot is in a different environment than what is depicted in the goal image, which shows a room with furniture. This inconsistency makes the subgoal image unsuitable for guiding the robot in its current task of turning right.NO: The goal image depicts a room with furniture, which is completely different from the current observation of a plain wall with shadows. For a "Turn right" task, the goal image should show a view that would logically follow the current observation if the robot were to turn right. The provided goal image does not fit this requirement and is inconsistent with the current observation and the task.NO: The goal image depicts an indoor space with furniture, which does not correspond to the robot's current observation of a plain wall. For a "Turn right" task, the goal image should logically follow from the current observation if the robot were to turn right. The provided goal image does not match the current environment, making it inconsistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task.NO: The goal image depicts an indoor space with furniture, while the current observation shows a plain wall. The environments do not match, and the subgoal image does not logically follow what the robot would see after turning right from its current location. Thus, the subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task.NO: The goal image shows a room with furniture, which is different from the current observation showing a plain wall. A consistent subgoal image for the task "Turn right" should depict a likely view the robot would see after turning right from its current position. The discrepancy between these two environments makes this subgoal image unsuitable.NO: The goal image depicts a room with furniture, while the current observation presents a plain wall without any visible context that matches the goal environment. For the task "Turn right," the goal image should represent a view that logically follows the robot's current position if it were to turn right. The mismatch between these two environments makes the subgoal image unsuitable.NO: The goal image does not match the current observation. The current observation shows a plain wall with shadows, while the goal image shows an indoor space with furniture. These environments are different, making the subgoal image inconsistent with the current observation and the task of turning right.NO: The goal image shows a room with furniture, which does not correspond to the current observation of a plain wall. For a "Turn right" task, the goal image should show a view that logically follows the current observation if the robot were to turn right. The provided goal image does not match the expected subsequent view, making it inconsistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task.NO: The goal image shows a room with furniture, which is not consistent with the current observation of a plain wall. For a "Turn right" task, the subgoal image should logically follow what the robot would see after turning right from its current position. The environments are different, making this subgoal image unsuitable for the given observation and tasks.9
