NO: The subgoal is bad because the current observation shows the robot in an office-like environment, and the goal image depicts a hallway. The low level task "Turn right" should result in an image that shows the robot having turned to the right within the same environment, not in a completely different location such as a hallway. The correct subgoal image should show consistency with the surroundings and orientation just after making a right turn.NO: The subgoal is bad because the current observation shows the robot in an office-like environment, while the goal image shows a hallway setting. For the low level task "Turn right," the goal image should depict a view consistent with the environment shown in the current observation, just rotated to the right. The goal image indicates a completely different location, which is not consistent with performing the action "Turn right" within the given current observation environment.NO: The subgoal is bad because the current observation shows the robot in an office-like environment, while the goal image shows a completely different hallway setting. For the low level task "Turn right," the goal image should depict a view consistent with the current environment but rotated to the right. The inconsistency in the locations indicates that the subgoal image does not correctly represent the immediate result of the robot executing a right turn from its current position.2
