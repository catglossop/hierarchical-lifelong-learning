NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation or the high-level task. The current observation shows an office or indoor workspace environment with chairs and desks, while the subgoal image is very abstract and does not clearly represent a consistent forward motion direction or provide a clear, actionable guide for the robot's task of going straight.NO: The subgoal image is not clear and does not provide specific visual information that would help the robot to continue moving straight in the current office environment. The goal image appears abstract and does not correspond well to the observable features in the current observation, such as the floor, chairs, and desks. A good subgoal should provide a recognizable and actionable visual cue for continuing the "Go straight" task.NO: The subgoal image does not provide a clear or coherent visual target that aligns with the current observation, the high-level task of "Go straight," or the current low-level task of "Go straight." The subgoal image is abstract and lacks distinct features that could guide the robot's forward movement in the current office environment filled with chairs and desks. A good subgoal should offer a recognizable continuation of the current scene to assist the robot in its task.0
