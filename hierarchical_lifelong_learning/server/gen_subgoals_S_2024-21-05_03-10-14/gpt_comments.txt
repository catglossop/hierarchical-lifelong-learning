NO: The goal image for the low-level task "Stop" should closely match the robot's current observation, indicating that the robot is stationary. In this case, the second image (goal image) shows a different hallway setup and possibly different furniture placement than the first image (current observation). They do not appear similar enough to confirm that the robot has reached its stopping point, which implies that the subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation and the task at hand.NO: The goal image for the low-level task "Stop" should be nearly identical to the robot's current observation, indicating that the robot has reached its desired stopping point and should remain stationary. In this case, the second image (goal image) does not match the first image (current observation) in terms of the hallway configuration and visual details like wall textures and furniture placements. Because of these discrepancies, the subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and the high-level task of stopping.NO: The goal image for the low-level task "Stop" should closely match the robot's current observation, indicating that the robot has reached its stopping point and is stationary. In this case, the second image (the goal image) shows a different scene from the robot's current observation. The hallway configuration, lighting, and structural features are not similar enough to confirm that the robot has stopped in the right location. This inconsistency indicates that the subgoal image is not suitable for the current observation and the task at hand.NO: The goal image for the low-level task "Stop" should be nearly identical to the robot's current observation, indicating that the robot has reached its desired stopping point and should remain stationary. In this case, the second image (goal image) does not match the first image (current observation) in terms of hallway configuration, lighting, and structural features. Because these two scenes are not similar, it indicates that the robot has not stopped in the correct location. Therefore, the subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation and the task of stopping.NO: The goal image for the low-level task "Stop" should closely match the robot's current observation to confirm that the robot has successfully stopped in the correct location. In this case, the second image (goal image) does not match the first image (current observation) in terms of hallway configuration, lighting, and structural features. These discrepancies indicate that the robot has not yet reached the desired stopping point. Therefore, the subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and the high-level task of stopping.NO: The goal image for the low-level task "Stop" should be almost identical to the robot's current observation, indicating that the robot has stopped in the correct location and is stationary. In this case, the second image (goal image) does not match the first image (current observation) in terms of hallway configuration, lighting, and structural elements. These differences indicate that the robot has not yet reached the desired stopping point. Therefore, the subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and the high-level task of stopping.NO: The goal image for the low-level task "Stop" should closely match the robot's current observation, indicating that the robot is in the correct spot and stationary. In this case, the second image (goal image) shows a different environment from the first image (current observation), including differences in hallway configuration, lighting, and structural features. These differences suggest that the robot's current location does not match the desired stopping point. Therefore, the subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and the high-level task of stopping.NO: The goal image for the low-level task "Stop" should closely match the robot's current observation, indicating that the robot has reached the correct location and is stationary. In this case, the second image (goal image) does not match the first image (current observation) in terms of hallway configuration, wall details, and overall layout. These differences suggest the robot's current location is not the intended stopping location. Therefore, the subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation and the low-level task of stopping.NO: The goal image for the low-level task "Stop" should be nearly identical to the robot's current observation, signaling that the robot has achieved its intended stopping point and is stationary. In this case, the second image (goal image) does not resemble the first image (current observation) in terms of hallway configuration, wall design, and environmental elements. These differences indicate that the subgoal image does not correctly align with the robot's current observation. Therefore, this subgoal is not consistent with the high-level task of stopping.NO: The goal image for the low-level task "Stop" should almost exactly match the robot's current observation, demonstrating that it has reached the intended stopping point and is stationary. In this instance, the second image (goal image) does not sufficiently resemble the first image (current observation). It appears to show a different section of a hallway with differing features and lighting conditions. As a result, this subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation and the high-level task of stopping.0
