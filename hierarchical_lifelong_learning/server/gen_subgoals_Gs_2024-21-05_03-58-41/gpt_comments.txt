NO: The subgoal image shows a hallway leading straight but the current observation shows the robot facing a door and containers. These environments do not match, meaning the generated subgoal is inconsistent with the current observation and the task to go straight.NO: The subgoal image depicts a corridor with different characteristics compared to the current observation, which shows doors, desks, and containers along the sides. Thus, the subgoal image is not consistent with the robotâ€™s current environment, making it a poor subgoal for the task of going straight in the current context.NO: The subgoal image shows a different environment compared to the current observation. The observation image shows a room with desks, chairs, and containers, while the subgoal image depicts a hallway without similar features. This inconsistency suggests that the subgoal image is not suitable for the current task of going straight.
