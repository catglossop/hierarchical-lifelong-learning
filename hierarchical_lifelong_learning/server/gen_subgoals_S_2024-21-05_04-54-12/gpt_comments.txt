NO: The subgoal image for the low level prompt "Stop" does not match the current observation. The current observation shows a space with multiple chairs and desks, while the subgoal image shows a different area with a focus on a different section of a workspace. The subgoal should be an image that closely matches the current observation to indicate the robot should stop in its current location.NO: The subgoal image for the low level prompt "Stop" does not match the current observation. The current observation shows a room with several chairs, desks, and other objects, whereas the subgoal image shows a different part of a workspace with different furniture and layout. For the robot to correctly stop, the goal image should represent the current environment closely enough to confirm that it has reached the correct stopping point.NO: The subgoal image for the low level prompt "Stop" is inconsistent with the current observation. The robot's current observation depicts a room with chairs and desks, while the subgoal image shows a different layout with different furniture. The subgoal image should closely resemble the current observation to confirm the robot is in the correct stopping position.0
