NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows an office-like environment with chairs and desks, while the goal image shows a hallway. For the low-level task "Turn left" within the high-level task "Turn left," the subgoal should be an image that represents what the robot would see after turning left in the same office-like environment—not an entirely different location like a hallway.NO: The goal image is bad because it does not align with the current observation or the low-level task "Turn left" within the context of the high-level task "Turn left." The current observation shows an office environment with chairs and desks, whereas the goal image depicts a hallway, which is a completely different setting. The subgoal image should represent what the robot would expect to see after making a left turn in the same office environment, not a transition to a hallway.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task.
