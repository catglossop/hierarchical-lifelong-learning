NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation or the specified high-level and low-level tasks. The current observation shows a white wall, suggesting that the robot is facing a flat surface. The subgoal image, on the other hand, shows what looks like a different part of the environment, likely indicating more context or objects that should appear after turning. To be consistent with the task of turning right, the subgoal should represent what the robot expects to see immediately after the right turn from its current position facing the wall.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation or the specified high-level and low-level tasks. The current observation shows a white wall, indicating the robot is facing a flat and featureless surface. The subgoal image shows a different environment with what seems to be darker objects or areas. For the task of turning right, the subgoal should depict what the robot anticipates seeing immediately after making the right turn from the perspective of facing the current white wall.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation or the specified high-level and low-level tasks. The current observation shows a white wall, indicating the robot is facing a flat and featureless surface. The subgoal image shows a part of the environment with dark objects or areas, which does not logically follow from the current observation of a blank wall. To be consistent with the task of turning right, the subgoal should depict the expected immediate scene after the right turn from the current position.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows the robot facing a blank white wall, while the subgoal image shows a distinctly different scene with dark areas and objects that would not logically follow from simply turning right from the current position. For the task "Turn right," the subgoal image should depict what the robot expects to see immediately after completing the right turn, starting from the view of the white wall.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a blank white wall, suggesting the robot is facing a featureless surface. The subgoal image shows a different environment with dark areas and objects, indicating a significant change in scenery. For a "Turn right" task, the subgoal image should depict the scene that the robot is expected to see immediately after turning right from its current position facing the white wall.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a white wall, indicating the robot is currently facing a blank surface. The goal image, however, shows what appears to be a darker and different part of the environment. For the robot to navigate the "Turn right" task successfully, the subgoal image should display the anticipated immediate view after turning right from this position facing the white wall.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a white wall, indicating the robot is facing a blank surface. The goal image displays a darker environment with objects or areas that are not visible in the current observation. For the task "Turn right," the subgoal image should represent the expected immediate view after the robot completes the turn, starting from the perspective of facing the white wall. The discrepancy between the current observation and the subgoal image indicates that this subgoal is not appropriate.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a blank white wall, indicating the robot is facing a featureless surface. The goal image, however, shows a different environment with dark areas and objects. For the task "Turn right," the subgoal image should depict what the robot expects to see immediately after completing the right turn from its current position facing the white wall. The discrepancy between the blank wall and the different environment in the subgoal image suggests that this subgoal is not appropriate.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a blank white wall, which indicates the robot is facing a plain, featureless surface. The goal image, however, shows a different environment with dark areas and objects, which are not related to the current observation. For the task "Turn right," the subgoal image should reflect what the robot anticipates seeing immediately after making the right turn from the position facing the white wall. The significant difference between the current observation and the subgoal image indicates that the subgoal is not appropriate.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a blank white wall, indicating the robot is facing a plain surface. The goal image, however, shows a vastly different environment with dark colors and objects, which does not logically follow from the current position. For the task "Turn right," the subgoal image should depict what the robot expects to see immediately after completing the right turn from the current position facing the white wall. The significant difference between the current observation and the goal image indicates that the subgoal is not appropriate and does not accurately reflect the immediate next step in the task.9
