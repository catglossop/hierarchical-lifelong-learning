NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and the task of turning right. The observation image shows a hallway with glass-walled rooms on the right side, while the subgoal image depicts a different room or corridor area. The environment in the subgoal image does not match the layout and features seen in the current observation, indicating that the subgoal is not guiding the robot correctly to perform the task of turning right within the same environment.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and the task of turning right. The current observation features a hallway with glass-walled rooms on the right, whereas the subgoal image shows a completely different environment with a more cluttered space and different lighting conditions. For a turn right command within the same environment, the subgoal image should reflect a right turn continuation of the same hallway, which it does not. Thus, the subgoal is not suitable.NO: The subgoal image does not align well with the current observation and the task of turning right. The initial observation is within a hallway with glass walls, while the subgoal image shows an entirely different space without the same architectural features or continuity. To be consistent with the task of turning right, the subgoal image should show what the robot would see after making a right turn in the same hallway, but it does not. Therefore, this subgoal is not appropriate for the task at hand.2
