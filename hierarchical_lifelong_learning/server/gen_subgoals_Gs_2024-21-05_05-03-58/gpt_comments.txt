NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation. The current observation shows a different environment with walls and objects close to the camera, whereas the goal image depicts a more open space possibly with windows and distant objects. This mismatch indicates that the subgoal image does not accurately represent the next step for the robot to continue going straight.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation. The current observation shows a hallway with a close-up view of objects and walls, while the goal image depicts a more open area that appears significantly different from the current scene. This inconsistency suggests that the subgoal image does not accurately represent the next immediate step for the robot to keep going straight.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation. The robot's current observation shows a hallway with recycling bins and other objects close to the camera. In contrast, the goal image depicts a spacious area that is significantly different from the current scene. Therefore, the goal image does not accurately represent the next step for the robot to continue going straight.0
