NO: The current observation and the goal image show two distinct locations: the current observation shows the robot in an office area with a person and some chairs, while the goal image depicts a corridor-like setting with different surroundings. For the low level task "Stop", the subgoal should reflect the robot stopping at its current position, not moving to a completely different location. The high level task "Stop" requires the robot to cease movement at its present position, making this subgoal inconsistent with the task at hand.NO: The current observation shows the robot in an office environment with chairs, desks, and people, while the goal image shows a corridor area. For the low level task "Stop", the goal image should reflect the robot's current position or a very similar one, indicating that it should stop at its present location. This subgoal is inappropriate because it implies a move to a completely different location, which is not consistent with the task "Stop".NO: The current observation shows the robot in an office environment with chairs, desks, and people, while the goal image shows a different corridor-like environment. For the low level task "Stop," the goal image should correspond to the robot stopping at its current position or a very similar one. This subgoal is inappropriate because it implies moving to a different location, which contradicts the instruction to "Stop." The high level task "Stop" necessitates the robot to cease movement at its current position, making this subgoal inconsistent with both the current observation and the tasks.0
