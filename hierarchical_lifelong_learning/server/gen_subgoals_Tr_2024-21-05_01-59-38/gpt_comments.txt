NO: The subgoal image does not align with the current observation considering the high-level task and low-level task. The current observation shows an office-like environment with doors and bright lighting, while the subgoal image shows a significantly different scene with a darker, possibly indoor setting and different structures. For a Turn right action, the environment should visually be the same with a 90-degree shift in perspective, which is not evident here.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation displays an office setting with open and closed doors, while the subgoal image shows a completely different indoor environment that looks significantly darker, with different structural features. For a Turn right action, the scene should logically show the same area but from a perspective rotated 90 degrees to the right, which is not apparent in the provided subgoal image.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a bright office environment with open and closed doors, while the subgoal image displays a much darker environment with different structural elements. For the Turn right high-level and low-level tasks, the goal image should represent a 90-degree right turn from the current observation, showing a consistent environment with a different perspective. The subgoal image does not fulfill this requirement.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The first image depicts an office environment with doors, bright lighting, and various items along the walls. The second image, however, shows a much darker environment with significantly different features that do not match the current location. For the Turn right task, the goal image should show a perspective consistent with turning 90 degrees to the right from the current observation while maintaining the same environment. The mismatch in environments indicates that the subgoal is not appropriate.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a bright office environment with desks, chairs, and doors, whereas the subgoal image presents a darker, possibly hallway or entrance area with somewhat different features. For a Turn right task, the subgoal should rotate the perspective to the right but remain consistent with the current environment. The visible difference in lighting and structural elements shows that the subgoal image does not align with the expected outcome of the turn right action in this particular setting.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a bright office environment with desks, chairs, and doors, while the subgoal image is much darker and appears to depict a different setting altogether. For the task Turn right, the subgoal image should show the same environment but rotated 90 degrees to the right. The difference in lighting and features indicates that the subgoal image does not match the expected perspective after executing a right turn.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a bright office-like environment with doors and various office furniture, while the subgoal image shows a much darker area with different structural elements. For the Turn right task, the subgoal should show a view consistent with a 90-degree rotation to the right within the same environment. The stark contrast in lighting and the environment indicates that the subgoal image does not match the expected outcome after executing a right turn from the current observation.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a bright office setting with clear structural features like doors and office equipment, whereas the subgoal image presents a significantly darker environment with different features. For the task Turn right, the subgoal should be a rotated view of the same environment, showing consistency in lighting and objects. The notable differences in the subgoal image indicate it does not accurately represent a 90-degree right turn from the current observation.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a brightly lit office environment with visible structural elements like doors and office equipment. The subgoal image depicts a darker space with different structures, which does not match the expected visual outcome of turning right in the current environment. For a Turn right action, the goal image should display a 90-degree rightward view of the same office environment, showing continuity in lighting and content. The significant differences between the images indicate that the subgoal is not appropriate for the given task.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a bright office-like setting with noticeable doors and office furniture, whereas the subgoal image depicts a much darker environment with different structural elements. For the Turn right task, the subgoal should represent a 90-degree rightward view of the same environment, indicating consistency in visual features and lighting. The substantial differences between the current observation and the subgoal image indicate that the subgoal does not accurately reflect the expected perspective after performing a right turn.0
