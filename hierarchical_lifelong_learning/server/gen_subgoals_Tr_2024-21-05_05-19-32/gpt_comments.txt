NO: The subgoal image should reflect a view that the robot would see after successfully turning to the right. In the current observation, the perspective suggests a straight hallway view. After turning right, we would expect the scene to reflect a different perspective indicating a turn has been made. The subgoal image still appears to show a straight hallway, which does not reflect the completion of a right turn.NO: The subgoal image should show a different perspective to reflect that a right turn has been made. The current observation shows the robot facing down a straight hallway, and after turning right, the field of view should have changed to show the new direction. The subgoal image still shows a straight hallway, indicating that the robot has not turned yet. Therefore, the subgoal image is not consistent with the expected result of the "Turn right" task.NO: The subgoal image should reflect a view that represents the robot having completed a right turn. The current observation shows the robot facing down a straight hallway, but the subgoal image also depicts a straight hallway. Since the goal is to turn right, the subgoal image should present a different perspective indicating a change in direction to the right. Thus, the subgoal image is not consistent with the execution of the "Turn right" task.0
