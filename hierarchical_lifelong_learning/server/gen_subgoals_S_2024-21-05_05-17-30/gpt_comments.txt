NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The goal image provided does not match the current observation; the layout, lighting, and surroundings are different. For the task "Stop," the goal image should closely resemble the robot's current observation to indicate that it has reached the desired point and should remain stationary.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a distinct environment with a specific layout, lighting, and objects (such as doors and a computer setup) that are not present in the subgoal image. For the task "Stop," the goal image should closely match the current observation to indicate that the robot is correctly positioned and should stop. The provided subgoal image does not fulfil this criteria.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a hallway with specific features such as doors, lighting, and office equipment that are not present in the subgoal image. For the task "Stop," the goal image should be nearly identical to the current observation image to indicate that the robot has reached the desired stopping point. The provided subgoal image does not match the current observation closely, suggesting a different location or misalignment.0
