NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation for the task "Go straight." The goal image for the low-level prompt seems to depict a different location with notable differences in the surroundings, such as the position and arrangement of furniture and lighting. To achieve a good subgoal for "Go straight," the generated image should closely resemble an environment that can be reached by moving forward from the current observation, showing a continuation of the visible path or hallway.NO: The subgoal image does not seem consistent with the current observation and the tasks specified. The details in the generated subgoal image, such as the structure and arrangement, do not seem to align with a simple continuation of moving straight within the current environment. For a good subgoal to "Go straight," the resulting image should closely reflect a plausible forward progression within the existing corridor or hallway visible in the initial observation, showing continuity in elements and layout.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation for the tasks "Go straight" at both the high and low levels. The subgoal image depicts significant differences in the environment, such as different wall structures and furnishings, which do not logically follow from simply moving straight from the current observation point. For the subgoal image to be good, it should present a forward progression within the same or similar corridor, maintaining continuity in the features and layout observed in the initial image.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation for the tasks "Go straight" at both the high and low levels. The environment shown in the goal image is notably different, indicating aspects such as different spatial arrangements and lighting conditions. For a subgoal image to be appropriate, it should illustrate a logical continuation of the current scene forward, maintaining similar visual elements and structure consistent with a straight path progression from the observation point.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation for the task "Go straight" at both the high and low levels. The generated subgoal image appears to show a transition to a different type of environment with different elements and layout, which does not follow logically from moving straight ahead in the current scene. A suitable subgoal should depict a plausible continuation of the current hallway, maintaining similar structural characteristics and visual continuity with the initial observation.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation for the tasks "Go straight" at both the high and low levels. The generated subgoal image shows various discrepancies in the environment, such as different structures and spatial arrangements that do not follow logically from the robot's current position. A suitable subgoal image should depict a probable continuation of the visible corridor, maintaining similar structural and spatial characteristics to ensure the robot can achieve the goal by moving straight ahead.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation for the tasks "Go straight" at both the high and low levels. The subgoal image shows an environment with different structural elements and spatial arrangement compared to the current observation. For the subgoal to be appropriate, it should depict a continuation of the current path or corridor, maintaining similar features and layout, which allows the robot to achieve the goal by moving straight ahead. The visible differences indicate that the robot would not simply reach the subgoal by continuing to move straight.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation for the high-level task "Go straight" and the low-level task "Go straight." The subgoal image depicts a significantly different environment with a distinct arrangement and features that do not logically follow from moving straight from the current observation. For the subgoal to be appropriate, it should show a continuation of the present hallway or path, with similar structural elements and layout that indicate a straight progression. The differences in visual elements suggest that the robot would not reach the depicted subgoal by moving straight ahead.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation for the high-level task "Go straight" and the low-level task "Go straight." The generated subgoal image does not reflect a straightforward continuation of the current scene as it shows significant differences in the environment, such as different layouts and lighting conditions. For the subgoal image to be appropriate, it should depict a logical continuation of the current hallway or path, maintaining similar structural elements and visual consistency that imply a straight movement forward from the present observation.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation for the high-level task "Go straight" and the low-level task "Go straight." The generated subgoal image depicts a different environment with varying elements and structure that do not logically follow from moving straight forward from the current location. For a subgoal to be appropriate, it should show a continuation of the current path or hallway, maintaining similar structural characteristics and visual elements to indicate a straightforward progression from where the robot currently is.0
