NO: The goal image does not seem to correspond to the current observation or the task at hand. The current observation shows an indoor office-like environment with chairs and desks, while the goal image depicts a hallway with no similar objects. Given that the robot's task is to Turn right, the subgoal image should reflect a right-turn perspective relative to the office scene shown in the observation. However, the goal image shows a completely different environment that looks like a hallway, rather than a view that would be seen after turning right within the same office setting.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows an office environment with desks and chairs, while the goal image depicts a hallway. The lower level task is to Turn right, so the subgoal image should show what the robot would observe after turning right from its current position, still within the office environment. Since the goal image does not match the office setting, it does not accurately reflect the expected view after performing a right turn in the current location.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows an office environment filled with desks and chairs. The goal image, however, shows a hallway, which does not match the office setting. Given the low level task Turn right, a suitable goal image should show the view after the robot has turned right within the same office environment visible in the current observation, reflecting a continuation or change of perspective rooted in the same location. Therefore, this goal image is not a good representation for the subgoal of turning right in the given scene.0
