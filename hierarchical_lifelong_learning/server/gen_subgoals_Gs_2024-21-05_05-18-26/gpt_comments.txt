NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation depicts a well-lit hallway with distinct features like doors and office spaces on the left, whereas the subgoal image appears to be more ambiguous and lacks the identifiable elements of the current environment. The goal image should provide a clearer and more direct advancement of the current scene to help the robot move straight down the hallway. The provided subgoal image does not match these criteria.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a well-lit hallway with clear, distinct features such as doors and office spaces, which provide a structured environment for navigation. On the other hand, the subgoal image is blurry, lacks identifiable features, and does not provide a clear sense of direction or continuity with the observed hallway. For the task "Go straight," the subgoal image should clearly depict a forward progression of the current scene to assist the robot in navigating straight. This subgoal image fails to meet these requirements.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation depicts a clearly structured, well-lit hallway with identifiable features such as doors and office spaces, which indicate the current environment. The subgoal image, however, is blurry and lacks distinct features or clear progression that reflects the current scene. For the high-level task "Go straight," an appropriate subgoal image should show a forward continuation of the hallway, maintaining the same level of detail and clarity, to guide the robot effectively. This subgoal image does not fulfill these criteria.2
