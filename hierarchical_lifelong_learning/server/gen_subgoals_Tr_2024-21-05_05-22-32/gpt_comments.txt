NO: The goal image does not correspond well with the current observation for the task "Turn right." The current observation shows a room with chairs and tables, along with a distinct blue and white wall and a clearly visible hallway. The goal image, however, shows a different scene with a blue object and furniture that does not match the setting in the observation image. For the low-level task "Turn right," the generated subgoal should depict how the scene should look immediately after turning right, ideally showing a similar environment but from a different angle, which is not the case here.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation for the task "Turn right." The observation image shows a room with chairs, tables, a blue and white wall, and a clearly visible hallway. The goal image shows a different scene with a blue object and different furniture that does not match the setting in the observation image. For the low-level task "Turn right," the generated subgoal should depict the environment after a right turn, ideally showing a similar setting but from a different angle, better aligned with the original scene. This goal image does not provide continuity from the current observation to the completion of the turn.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation for the task "Turn right." The observation image shows a room with chairs, tables, and a distinct blue and white wall, with a hallway visible. The goal image depicts a different environment with a blue object and furniture that do not match the setting in the observation image. For the low-level task "Turn right," the generated subgoal should show the expected view immediately after turning right, which should be a continuation or different angle of the current environment. This goal image does not align with the original scene or task of turning right, making it an unsuitable subgoal.2
