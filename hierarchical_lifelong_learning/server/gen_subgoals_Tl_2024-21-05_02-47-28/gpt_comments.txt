NO: The subgoal is not consistent because the current observation shows a white wall, indicating the robot is facing directly towards a surface with no visible hallway or directional options. In contrast, the goal image shows a view of a hallway, which would be the result of a successful turn. Thus, the goal image does not accurately reflect the immediate next state after the robot performs a "Turn left" from its current position.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, the high-level task of "Turn left," and the low-level task of "Turn left." The current observation shows the robot facing directly towards a plain white wall, with no indication of a hallway or directional options. The goal image, depicting a hallway, suggests a scene where the robot has completed the turn and is facing down a corridor. To be consistent, the subgoal image should more accurately reflect what the robot would see immediately after starting to turn left from its current position.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, the high-level task of "Turn left," and the low-level task of "Turn left." The current observation shows the robot facing a white wall with no visible corridor, while the goal image shows a view of a hallway, which indicates the result of a successful turn. This discrepancy means the goal image does not accurately reflect the immediate next state after the robot begins turning left from its current position.NO: The goal image is not consistent with the current observation, the high-level task of "Turn left," and the low-level task of "Turn left." The current observation shows the robot facing a white wall, indicating it is currently facing a surface with no visible hallway. Meanwhile, the goal image shows a hallway, indicating a location where navigation is possible. This means the goal image does not appropriately reflect the expected immediate result of a "Turn left" action from the current position.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, the high-level task of "Turn left," and the low-level task of "Turn left." The current observation shows the robot facing a white wall with no visible hallway or turn indication. The goal image, however, shows a hallway, suggesting that the robot has turned and is now facing down a corridor. For the subgoal to be accurate, it should reflect a state that would realistically follow from the robot beginning a turn left from its current position facing the wall.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, the high-level task of "Turn left," and the low-level task of "Turn left." The robot's current observation shows a white wall with no visible hallway or indication that the robot is in a position to make a turn. On the other hand, the goal image shows a hallway, implying that the robot has completed a turn and is now facing a corridor. This does not accurately represent the expected immediate result of the robot beginning to turn left from its current position.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, the high-level task of "Turn left," and the low-level task of "Turn left." The robot's current observation shows it facing a white wall with no visible hallway or directional indication. The goal image, on the other hand, shows a hallway, implying that the robot would be facing down a corridor after completing the turn. There should be an intermediate state more reflective of the robot's immediate environment after starting to turn left.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, the high-level task of "Turn left," and the low-level task of "Turn left." The robot's current observation shows it staring at a white wall with no visible hallway, indicating it is likely facing a surface directly. The goal image, on the other hand, depicts a hallway, suggesting the robot has completed the turn and is facing down a corridor. Therefore, the subgoal image does not appropriately reflect the expected immediate result of the robot beginning to turn left from its current position.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, the high-level task of "Turn left," and the low-level task of "Turn left." The robot's current observation shows it facing a white wall, indicating there is no visible hallway or turning point in its immediate view. The goal image shows a hallway, suggesting a new direction or path that becomes visible only after the turn is completed. For the subgoal to be good, it should more accurately reflect an intermediate state that aligns with the robot beginning or mid-way through the turn from its current position.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, the high-level task of "Turn left," and the low-level task of "Turn left." The robot's current observation shows a plain white wall with no visible hallway or turn indicator. The goal image, however, depicts a hallway, which suggests that the robot has already completed the turn and is now facing down a corridor. For the subgoal to be accurate, it should reflect an intermediate state that the robot would see as it begins or completes the turn from its current position.9
