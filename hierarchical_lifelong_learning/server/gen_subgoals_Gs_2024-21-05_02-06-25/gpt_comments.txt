NO: The subgoal image does not seem consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The environment in the current observation has well-lit conditions and a clear view down the hallway with specific landmarks such as doors and windows. The subgoal image, however, appears to be darker and shows a different view with different lighting conditions and spatial features that do not match the initial observation. For a "Go straight" task, the subgoal image should show a scenario where the robot has moved further down the same hallway while maintaining similar environmental landmarks.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a well-lit hallway with distinct features like doors and lights. The subgoal image, on the other hand, is much darker and seems to have different spatial features. For the task "Go straight," the goal image should represent a point further down the same hallway, maintaining similar lighting and visible features like the doors and lights seen in the initial observation.NO: The subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a well-lit hallway with specific features such as doors and lights. The subgoal image is darker and shows a different environment with distinct spatial features, likely indicating a significant change in location or lighting. For the "Go straight" task, the subgoal image should depict the same hallway observed initially but from a position further down the hall, retaining similar lighting conditions and visible landmarks.NO: The subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation depicts a well-lit hallway with clear visible features such as doors, lights, and a specific layout. The subgoal image, however, is darker and shows a different layout and features that do not match the current hallway. For the task "Go straight," the subgoal image should show a position further down the same hallway with similar lighting and landmarks for consistency.NO: The subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation displays a well-lit hallway with doors and lights visible along the corridor. The subgoal image, however, is darker and has a different layout and less visible detail that do not match the features of the current hallway. For the "Go straight" task, the subgoal image should represent a point further down the same hallway, maintaining similar brightness and visible elements like doors and lights for consistency.NO: The subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a well-lit hallway with distinctive features such as doors and light fixtures. The subgoal image appears darker with different spatial characteristics and landmarks, indicating a significant change in environment. For the task "Go straight," the subgoal image should depict a location further down the same hallway with similar lighting and features to ensure continuity and accuracy in navigation.NO: The subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a well-lit hallway with distinct features like doors, walls, and lights. The subgoal image is darker and lacks the clear, consistent features seen in the observation image. For the task "Go straight," the subgoal image should depict a location further down the same hallway while maintaining similar lighting conditions and visible features like the ones in the initial observation.NO: The subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a well-lit hallway with clear, distinguishable features such as doors and lights. The subgoal image, however, is significantly darker and displays a different layout and structure, lacking the consistency required for the task "Go straight". For successful navigation, the subgoal image should illustrate a continuation of the current hallway, exhibiting similar lighting and landmarks to ensure accurate progression.NO: The subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation shows a well-lit corridor with clear features such as doors and lights. The subgoal image is much darker and depicts a different environment that lacks these specific features, indicating a change in location rather than a continuation of moving straight ahead. For consistent navigation, the subgoal image should reflect a point further down the same hallway while maintaining similar lighting and visible landmarks.NO: The subgoal image is inconsistent with the current observation, high-level task, and low-level task. The current observation displays a well-lit hallway with clear features such as doors, a whiteboard, and lights. The subgoal image is darker, shows different features, and does not seem to be a continuation of the same environment. For the task "Go straight," the subgoal should show a point further down the same hallway while maintaining similar lighting and the same visible features to ensure accurate and consistent navigation.0
