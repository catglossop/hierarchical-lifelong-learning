NO: The goal image for the low level task "Stop" does not match the current observation. The robot's current observation shows an office environment with chairs and desks, while the goal image depicts a different hallway-like environment. For a "Stop" task, the observation and the goal image should be the same, indicating that the robot is supposed to stop at its current position.NO: The goal image for the low-level task "Stop" does not match the current observation, which indicates the robot is in a different location. For a "Stop" task, the goal image should be consistent with the robot's current observation, signifying that the robot should stop at its current position. The differing environments suggest that this is not the correct subgoal image for the "Stop" task.NO: The goal image for the low-level task "Stop" does not match the current observation. The robot's current observation shows furniture and office equipment, whereas the goal image shows a corridor or hallway that is distinctly different. For the task "Stop" to be consistent, the goal image should reflect the current environment so that the robot understands it should stop in its current position.0
