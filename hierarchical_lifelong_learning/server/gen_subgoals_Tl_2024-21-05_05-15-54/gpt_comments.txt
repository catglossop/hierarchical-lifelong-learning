NO: The subgoal image does not appear consistent with the current observation or the task of turning left. The observation shows a hallway with a long straight path, while the subgoal image shows a hallway with a more curved perspective or different angle suggesting a different section altogether. There is no clear indication that a left turn has been made or is necessary to reach a corresponding viewpoint.NO: The subgoal image does not correlate well with the goal of turning left. The first image shows a straight hallway, suggesting the robot is approaching a turn or possibly hasn't turned yet. The second image, instead of showing a view consistent with having turned left, shows another straight hallway with a perspective that doesn't give clear evidence of a left turn being made. To match a 'Turn left' instruction, a significant shift in perspective reflecting a 90-degree left turn from the current position should be visible.NO: The subgoal image does not align well with the current observation or the task of turning left. The current observation shows a straight path in a hallway, suggesting the robot is approaching a decision point for a potential turn. The subgoal image continues to depict a straight hallway with no clear indication of a left turn. For turning left, the subgoal image should show a perspective facing or after a leftward turn, which is not evident in the provided goal image.1
