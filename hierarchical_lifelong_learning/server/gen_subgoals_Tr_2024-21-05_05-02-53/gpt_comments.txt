NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The observation shows an indoor office environment with chairs and desks, while the subgoal image depicts a hallway. To turn right, the subgoal image should display a scene similar to the current environment but rotated to the right, maintaining the context of the office surroundings.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows an office environment with chairs and desks, while the subgoal image shows a hallway. For the task of turning right, the subgoal image should depict the same environment but rotated to the right, preserving the indoor office setting.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation, high level task, and low level task. The current observation shows an office environment with chairs and desks, while the subgoal image depicts a hallway. For the task of turning right, the subgoal image should reflect the same indoor office environment but with the perspective rotated to the right, maintaining the continuity of the surroundings.0
