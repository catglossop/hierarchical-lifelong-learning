NO: The subgoal image does not match the current observation. The current observation shows an environment with desks and chairs, while the subgoal image shows a hallway or passage that does not appear to have desks or chairs in the same arrangement. Therefore, this subgoal is not consistent with the current observation for the task of turning right within the current environment.NO: The subgoal image does not align with the current observation. From the current observation, the robot is in an office-like environment with chairs, desks, and other office equipment. The subgoal image displays a hallway or corridor without these elements. For the task of turning right, the generated subgoal should depict a view consistent with the environment the robot is currently in, which is not the case here.NO: The subgoal image is not consistent with the current observation and the task of turning right. The current observation shows an office environment with chairs and desks. The subgoal image, on the other hand, shows a passageway or hallway, which does not match the current environment. For a low-level task of turning right, the generated subgoal should depict an expected view right after the turn within the same office setting, which this subgoal image does not provide.0
